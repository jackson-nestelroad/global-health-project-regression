# Multiple Linear Regression for University COVID-19 Policies in the United States
This repository is a single script for a group research project for my **Global Health and Society** course.
Looking at universities across the United States, our team quantified various aspects of university reopening plans for the Fall 2020 semester with regards to mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
We used **Multiple Linear Regression** to look at the impact of several variables on a university's average COVID-19 positivity rate over the first eight weeks of the Fall 2020 semester.
